#### Welcome to my calorie tracking web application. This application was created using React, Redux, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI, React Google Charts, and Axios.

## Getting Started

1.  Upon visiting this website for the first time, users will be greeted with a profile page. While it is not necessary to create a profile to use the website, it is recommended. Creating a profile allows the application to calculate the recommended number of calories a user should be consuming daily.

## Tracker Page

1.  If a profile was created: users will be redirected to the **_Tracker_** page.
2.  If a profile was not created, users can get to the **_Tracker_** page by clicking on the **Tracker** link located towards the top right corner.

3.  To start tracking calories, start by clicking on the **_ADD FOOD_** link.
4.  After clicking the **_ADD FOOD_** link, users will see a search bar. After typing a food item into the search bar and pressing the **Search** button, a list of foods will populate below the search bar. If user does not see the food item they are looking for, try to be specific and include brand names or restaurant names.

5.  Click on the **+** button to add the food item to the tracker. _Please note: the database data gives calorie data per one hundred gram serving of the food item. Adding the food item multiple times might be required depending on how many servings are being consumed_.
